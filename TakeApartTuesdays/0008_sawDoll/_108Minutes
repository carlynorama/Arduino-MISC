/*
This program was written to control the 
SAW 3 Digital Voice Recorder available at
All Electronics.

It is a salute to LOST - the clip will play
every 108 minutes. If you press press a button
it will record a new clip, but you really could
just mannually do that with the SAW doll's own
button if you like.
